<p>This is the experiment page for Laronix Data Recording.<br>
    <br>
    1. Select one example from below, a sound file, with its reference transcription and its speaking rate will be loaded as inputs.<br>
     You can check the sound file first and prepare for reading the transcription at a similar tempo.<br>
    2. Delete the sound file (click the X button on the right), a recording button will appear.<br>
    3. Click the recording button to start, click again to stop. Make sure you are not mispronouncing or including any detectable noises.<br>
    4. Click &quot;Submit&quot; button and wait for the result.<br>
    5. Please check the message box to see the feedback, if ERROR appears, delete your previous recording and try again :).<br>
    6. If &quot;GOOD JOB!&quot; message appears, click &quot;Flag as Perfect&quot; and start another recording.<br>
    7. If you try several times (N >= 10) and still can not clear the mission, you can flag your best recording by clicking &quot;Doubtful Speaking Rate&quot; or &quot;Doubtful Naturalness&quot;. <br>
     Yet this seldom happens, so please try to meet the system's requirement first!<br>
    8. If you have any other question, Please contact kevin@laronix.com </p>
